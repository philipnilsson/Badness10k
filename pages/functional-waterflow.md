I recently came across an interview question from Twitter at [Michael Kozakov's
blog](https://medium.com/@bearsandsharks/i-failed-a-twitter-interview-52062fbb534b#.tlspyu7h0)

After some thought I managed to boil this down to a simple functional
one-liner I thought was interesting enough to share. First, let's take
a look at the problem definition.

Quoting the original source:

How would we go about finding a solution to this problem? I find this
to be especially interesting, as there were many solutions posted to
this problem [over
here](https://gist.github.com/mkozakov/59af0fd5bddbed1a0399) that
were incorrect. My own first intuition led me to a solution that
didn't cover all cases as well.

How can we analyze this problem such that we can get a solution and
implementation that we can be confident is correct?

The approach I suggest would be to start with the question: "Given a
block in this graph, when will it be filled with water?" We can assume
there will be enough rain to fill any holes as far as is possible, so the
only question is when the water will spill over to the side.

Then, the condition for the water to stay in a given square is that
there is some wall to the **left** that is higher than the height of the
given square, as well as some wall to the **right** that is higher that
the height of the given square.

If we let $h_i$ be the height of index $i$, and let
$high_i^{left}$ denote the highest point to the left of index
$i$, and similarly define $high_i^{right}$ we can express this
as.

> A square of height $h_i$, is filled when
> $$ h_i \leq high_i^{left} \land h_i \leq high_i^{right} $$

We can simplify the conjunction by expressing this via $min$

$$ h_i \leq min(high_i^{left}, high_i^{right}) $$

We can now easily see that the height of the water level of each
index, which we'll call $level_i$ can be expressed by turning this
inequality into an equality.

$$ level_i = min(high_i^{left}, high_i^{right}) $$

This leaves us in good shape for actually computing the answer. We
start by calculating the values if $high$. Starting with $high_i^{left}$ we note that
this can be expressed as a simple recursive equation in terms of $h$ and itself.

$$ high_0^{left} = h_0 $$

$$ high\_{i+1}^{left} = max(h\_{i+1} , high_i^{left}) $$

This a recursive relation, where we apply an operator $max$ to
accumulate values in the list $h$. We have a tool in the
functional programming arsenal for computing exactly this, namely
[_scanl1_](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.6.0.1/docs/Prelude.html#v:scanl1).

For e.g. the input `h = [2,5,1,2,3,4,7,7,6]` from the original post, we get

<pre>scanl1 max h
>> [2,5,5,5,5,5,7,7,7]
</pre>

Similarly for $high_{right}$ we have

$$ high_n^{right} = h_n $$

$$ high\_{i-1}^{right} = max(h\_{i} , high_i^{left}) $$

And we can use `scanr1` to compute it

<pre>scanr1 max h
>> [7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,6]
</pre>

Now getting back to $level$, which, as we recall, was defined as

> $$ level_i = min(high_i^{left}, high_i^{right}) $$

This is easy to compute, we only need to apply a function ($min$)
element-wise, which we can do via an application of `zipWith`

<pre>zipWith min (scanl1 max h) (scanr1 max h)
>> [2,5,5,5,5,5,7,7,6]
</pre>

Now we have defined the height of the water level at each index, all
that is left is subtract the height of the "ground", element-wise, to
get the amount of water contributed at each index.

<pre>let level h =
  zipWith min (scanl1 max h) (scanr1 max h)

zipWith (-) (level h) h
>> [0,0,4,3,2,1,0,0,0]
</pre>

Now all that remains is taking the sum of the contributions at each
index. This is, of course, as simple as applying the `sum` function.

Our complete implementation is now

<pre>water h = sum $
  zipWith (-)
    (zipWith min (scanl1 max h) (scanr1 max h))
    h

water [2,5,1,2,3,4,7,7,6]
>> 10
</pre>

We can now be confident that our implementation is correct. The
breakdown of the problem corresponds nicely to our mathematical
analysis, and our code is clean and declarative. The only price we
have to pay is a linear use of extra space (arising from the use of
`scanr1`), which is cleverly avoided in [Michael Kozakov's imperative
solution](https://gist.github.com/mkozakov/59af0fd5bddbed1a0399).
