Introduction
------------

An important concept in functional programming is that of
*composition*, where an aggregate or complex element can be described
as the assembly of smaller parts.

Not all forms of composition are the same however. Consider the two
problems

1) Assembling the pieces of a jigsaw-puzzle.
2) Assemble a piece of IKEA furniture from its parts.

Putting puzzle pieces together and assembling furniture both involve
composing smaller pieces into more complex, aggregate parts.

There is a difference between these two activities however, in that
the assembly of furniture is highly linear and sequential. Generally
it is necessary to start at the very first page of the manual, and
following the instructions in order, from the first to the last.

Solving a puzzle is more freeform. Pieces from anywhere within it can
be put together without enforcing any particlar order, like starting
in the top left corner. This means solving a puzzle is easily
parallelizable --- simply enlist a friend to help solve a different part
of the puzzle than yourself, and at any point combine the pieces from
both efforts if possible.

Can we algebraically describe the difference between these two
problems? It turns out that it is easy to do so, by introducing a
simple requirement on the method of composition. The key observation
is that composition of puzzle pieces satisfy the following rule.

<div class="figure">
  <img src="/Badness10k/images/puzzle-pieces.png" />
</div>

That is, given three puzzle pieces, these can be put together in two
different ways, starting by combining the first and second, or staring
with the second and third. Either way the final result is required
to be the same.

  <img src="/Badness10k/images/pieces-composed.png" />
</div>

A method of composition satisfying the above constraint is said to be
*associative*. For a larger set of puzzle pieces the associativity law
can be repeatedly applied, until it is possible to make the statement
that a jigsaw can be assembled in any order.

Definition
----------

A **Semigroup** is a data type together with a method of composition, ⊕,
satisfying the associativity rule

```
a ⊕ (b ⊕ c) = (a ⊕ b) ⊕ c
```

Examples
--------

Numbers with addition are Semigroups, as well as numbers with
multiplication, maximum and minimum. Note that this means that as with
[Identity elements](./2016-06-29-functional-patterns-identity-element.html),
the same datatype can have a given algebraic structure in multiple
ways.

```javascript
a + (b + c) = (a + b) + c
a * (b * c) = (a * b) * c
max(a, max(b, c)) = max(max(a, b), c)
min(a, min(b, c)) = min(min(a, b), c)
```

<hr>

Strings with string-concatenation form a semigroup. We write `++` for
concatenation, so `"foo" ++ "bar"` is `"foobar"`. Clearly it holds that

```javascript
a ++ (b ++ c) = (a ++ b) ++ c
```

Similarly, lists or arrays, with list/array-concatenation are
semigroups. We write `++` also for this type of concatenation, so
`[1, 2] ++ [3, 4, 5]` is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`

<hr>

The booleans are semigroups, with both `||` and `&&`

```
a && (b && c) = (a && b) && c
a || (b || c) = (a || b) || c
```

<hr>

A very important associative operation is function composition. That
is, for a triple of functions `f`, `g` and `h`

```
f ∘ (g ∘ h) = (f ∘ g) ∘ h
```

Matrix multiplication is a binary operation that encodes the behaviour
of composition of linear functions, and is thus also associative,
making the set of `n`-by-`n` matrices a semigroup for any `n`.


<hr>

A *frequency map* is a map from values to "frequencies", which are
numbers intuitively representing the number of times a particular
value has been "counted". This is a natural way of modelling e.g. the
outcome of an election. In an election with candidates `A`, `B`, `C`
and `D`, the results of counting the votes can be represented as a
frequency map.

```
{ A: 2, B: 4, C: 3, D: 1 }
```
<figcaption>
A frequency map example, where candidate `A` has 2 votes, `B` has 4 etc
</figcaption>

The composition operation simply adds frequencies.

```
addFrequencies({ A: 2, B: 1, C: 3 }, { B: 3, C: 1, D: 5 })
>> { A: 2, B: 4, C: 4, D: 5 }
```

This operation is associative for all values. Notice that calculating
the results of an election is a typical example of a parallelizable
problem. No single person counts each vote in a large election, but
rather results are aggregated first by district, the summarized into
complete results. The fact that this is possible to do is neatly
described algebraically by the associativity of the `addFrequencies`
operation.

<hr>

Comparators are semigroups. A comparator is a function from two
values to the set `{ LESS, EQUAL, GREATER }`. In Java and many other
languages `LESS` is represented by any number < `0`, `EQUAL` by `0` and
`GREATER` by any number > `0`, so that one can write

```
function compareNumbers(i, j) {
    return i - j;
}
```

The result of composing two comparators is a new comparator that
compares by its parts in right-biased-order. For instance
`firstNameComparator ⊕ lastNameComparator` is a comparator that
compares first by `lastName` then by `firstName`.

```
function composeComparators(c, d) {
   return (x, y) => {
      const comparisonResult = d(x, y);
      if (comparisonResult === EQUAL) {
        return c(x, y);
      }
      return comparisonResult;
   };
}
```

As an exercise, check that comparator-composition is associative to
verify that comparators for a semigroup.

<hr>

A "weird" associative operation is `⨮`, which is defined as

```javascript
x ⨮ y = y
```

that is, it takes two arguments and discards the first. *Any* type is
a semigroup paired with this operation.

Similary one can define `⨭` as the operation that discards its second
argument, also forming the composition of a semigroup.

<hr>

Pairs of elements that are semigroups are semigroups with composition
defined component-wise. For example `(4, "foo") ⊕ (7, "bar") = (11,
"foobar")` where we use the `+` semigroup on numbers and `++` on
strings.

Applications
------------

The associativity condition is a suitable design goal in many
situations, for the reason that it encodes the notion that the order
of taking operations is irrelevant. Note that this is different from
saying that the order of *elements* is important. For instance the
expression `"foo" ++ "bar"` is not the same as `"bar" ++ "foo"`.

Complex behaviour described through associative composition is simpler
and easier to understand, since the order of operations is not
important.

A notable example in the javascript world that *fails* the
associativity condition is the `.pipe` method in the `gulp` build
system.

<hr>

The form of parallelism induced by the associativity of the semigroup
operation is heavily relied upon in the *Map-Reduce* programming
model. We'll expound on this in more detail in a later article, as
this is more easily developed algebraically after defining the concept
of a *Monoid*.
